# quiver

Clojure 1.5 new threading macros
[new threading macros](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/changes.md#24-new-threading-macros)
as a library.

This is handy if your project runs some pre 1.5 clojure version and
want to use this already.

This is just copy paste work, so it will/should work the same as the original.

## Installation

Add this to your dependencies:

```clojure
[cc.qbits/quiver 1.0.0]
```

then

```clojure
(require '[qbits.quiver :as quiver])

```
